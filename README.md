This is the release code for the paper "Learning Granular Media Avalanche Behavior for Indirectly Manipulating Obstacles on a Granular Slope" accepted to the 8th Coneference of Robot Learning.

The data collection and experiment execution are all on physics experiment, we released the code for training the ViT in the paper as well as part of the dataset to verify the training performance. Please contact haodihu@usc.edu if you have questions regards the project.

How to run the project:
The data is processed and the ViT is configured followed the way describled in the paper, download entire repo and run the Vit.py.

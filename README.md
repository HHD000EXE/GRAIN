This is the release code for the paper "Learning Granular Media Avalanche Behavior for Indirectly Manipulating Obstacles on a Granular Slope" accepted to the 8th Conference of Robot Learning.

The data collection and experiment execution are all on physics experiments, we released the code for training the ViT in the paper as well as part of the dataset to verify the training performance. Please contact haodihu@usc.edu if you have questions regarding the project.

How to run the project:
The data is processed and the ViT is configured following the way described in the paper, download the entire repo and run the Vit.py.
